            <em>Hardworking and focus is a<strong><a href="https://leverageedu.com/blog/importance-of-education/"> KEY for education</a></strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>"Compassion is a spontaneous movement of wholeness. It is not a studied decision to help the poor, to be kind to the
            unfortunate. Compassion has a tremendous momentum that naturally, choicelessly moves us to worthy action. It has the
            force of intelligence, creativity, and the strength of love. This vast intelligence that orders the cosmos is available to all.</p>
